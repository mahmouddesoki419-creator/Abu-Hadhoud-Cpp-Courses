    /* From the pointer, we can access the Address/Value of a variable */

    //Accessing the Address:
    cout << "Address of num (using num) = " << &num << endl; //output: Address
    cout << "Address of num (using pointer) = " << pointer << endl; // output: same Address
    //Accessing the Value:
    cout << "Value of num (using num) = " << num << endl; //output: 15
    cout << "Value of num (using pointer) = " << *pointer << endl; //output: 15
    //Changing the Value:

    cout << "Value of num (using num) = " << num << endl; //output: 3
    cout << "Value of num (using pointer) = " << *pointer << endl; //output: 3

    /* Common Mistakes using Pointers:
        1. The pointer itself store the ADDRESS of the variable NOT the VALUE of it
          pointer = num; (ERROR)
          pointer = &num; (CORRECT)
        2. The *pointer stores/leads to the VALUE of the variable not the ADDRESS
          *pointer = &num; (ERROR)
          *pointer = num + 10; (CORRECT) //Increases the value of num by 10
          
        3. The pointer can change the variable at which it's pointing AS LONG AS the second variable has the same Type of the original variable
          int num1 = 10, *pointerInt;
          short num2 = 20;
          pointerInt = &num1; (CORRECT)
          pointerInt = &num2; (ERROR)
          int num3 = 0;
          pointerInt = &num3; (CORRECT)

    cout << &arr[0] << endl; //output: same Address
    cout << pointerArr << endl << endl; //output: same Address
    
    //If you want to access the address of arr[n], use pointerArr + n
    cout << &arr[2] << endl; //output: Address of third element
    cout << pointerArr + 2 << endl; //output: same Address

    //If you want to access the Value of arr[n], use *(pointer + n)
    cout << *(pointerArr + 2) << endl << endl; //output: 3
    *(pointerArr + 3) = 40; //Changes the forth element to 40

    //I tried using a pointer of string and a pointer of char[], but its behaviour was inapprehensible
